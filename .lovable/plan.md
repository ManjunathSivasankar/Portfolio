# ✨ Personal Portfolio Website

A visually immersive, scroll-driven portfolio with soft gradient aesthetics, glassmorphism, and cinematic animations - designed to feel premium, calm, and unforgettable.

---

## 🎨 Visual Identity & Theme

- **Color palette**: Light-to-medium grey gradients, white layers, with subtle pastel blue/soft violet/muted mint accents
- **Texture**: Noise grain overlays, glassmorphism cards, soft blur backgrounds
- **Typography**: Clean modern sans-serif, generous spacing
- **Overall feel**: Premium, minimal, futuristic - like a personal brand, not a template

---

## 🎬 Animations & Motion

- **Page load**: Cinematic entrance - name fades in with a slow elegant reveal, background particles/gradient slowly animate
- **Scroll-based reveals**: Each section fades/slides in as you scroll (staggered animations)
- **Floating UI elements**: Subtle floating shapes and soft glow accents in the background
- **Hover effects**: Smooth scale, glow, and glassmorphism shifts on interactive cards
- **Smooth transitions**: All interactions feel fluid and intentional
